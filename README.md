# Self-balancing-robot
Self-balancing robot: One feature that sets out this robot from other self-balancing robots is that it does not use an accelerometer for PID control input; instead it uses an analog sensor. It is surprising that you can reach near the stability of accelerometer signals. But not the exact. Included visual overview of the project and schematic view.
